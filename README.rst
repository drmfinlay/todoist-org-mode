================

Convert Todoist projects into Org mode files


What this project does
----------------------

This is a `Python language <https://www.python.org/>`__ project with code to retrieve
Todoist projects, sections and items using the Todoist `Sync API (v8)
<https://doist.github.io/todoist-api/sync/v8/>`__ and convert them into Org mode
headings to be written to files.

`Todoist <https://todoist.com/>`__ is an application for maintaining to-do lists and
planning projects. `Org mode <https://orgmode.org/>`__ is a `GNU Emacs
<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`__ major mode for convenient plain text markup
and much more, including maintaining to-do lists and planning projects.

*todoist-org-mode* Python files:

- ``todoist2org`` - Library for generating Org mode headings from Todoist projects,
  sections and items.
- ``todoist2org_convert`` - Command-line (CLI) program to retrieve Todoist projects,
  sections and items, convert them to Org mode headings using ``todoist2org`` and
  write each heading to stdout or to the specified output file.

No part of this project modifies remote Todoist user data, it is only retrieved and
converted locally.

Using this project
------------------

To use this project, follow the steps below.

#. Clone or download and extract the repository.

   .. code:: shell

      git clone https://github.com/drmfinlay/todoist-org-mode.git

#. Open a command prompt or terminal in the repository's root directory.

   .. code:: shell

      cd todoist-org-mode

#. Install the required dependencies.

   .. code:: shell

      pip install -r requirements.txt


``todoist2org_convert`` program usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ``todoist2org_convert``, passing your Todoist API token and an optional output
file path as the arguments. Your API token can be found under Settings->Integrations.

.. code:: shell

   # Either convert and print all headings to stdout.
   python todoist2org_convert.py 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567

   # Or convert and write all headings to output.org.
   python todoist2org_convert.py 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 -o output.org


``todoist2org`` library usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``todoist2org`` library can be used for custom conversion of Todoist projects,
sections and/or items. For example, it could be used to convert all items in the
special Inbox project and write an Inbox.org file:

.. code:: Python

   import todoist2org

   # Use the API token to sync user resources.
   api_token = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
   state = todoist2org.sync_todoist_state(api_token)

   # Assume the API request was successful and the Inbox project is first.
   project = state["projects"][0]
   project_id = project["id"]

   # Write an Org mode file header followed by each generated heading to Inbox.org.
   with open("Inbox.org", "w") as f:
       for line in todoist2org.generate_file_header(state, "Inbox"):
           f.write(line + "\n")
       f.write("\n")
       for heading in todoist2org.generate_project_headings(state, project_id, False):
        f.write(heading + "\n")


Limitations
-----------

- This project does **not** work in the other direction, i.e. it will **not** parse
  Org mode files and update Todoist with the equivalent projects, sections and items.

- Conversion of recurring due dates is **not** supported. Project items with
  recurring due dates will be tagged with ``:IS_RECURRING:`` for manual user
  conversion. Warnings will be logged for every item encountered that has a recurring
  due date. See the `Org Manual Repeated Tasks
  <https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html>`__ section for how to specify
  recurring due dates in Org mode.

- Project comments, item comments, calendar feeds, reminders and templates are
  **not** brought over in the conversion process.

- Archived projects and sections are not included by default. There is an optional
  CLI ``-a`` / ``--include-archived`` argument and equivalent library function
  parameters that can be used to include archived projects and sections. If these are
  used, archived projects and sections will be tagged with ``:ARCHIVED:`` and output
  in roughly their original positions as if they were never archived. They will not
  be filed under a separate heading.
